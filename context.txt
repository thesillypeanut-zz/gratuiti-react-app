Disaster mitigation measures are those that eliminate or reduce the impacts and risks of hazards through  measures taken before an emergency or disaster occurs.

Disaster mitigation measures may be structural (e.g. flood dikes) or non-structural (e.g. land use zoning). Mitigation activities should incorporate the measurement and assessment of the evolving risk environment. Activities may include the creation of comprehensive, pro-active tools that help decide where to focus funding and efforts in risk reduction.

Other examples of mitigation measures include:
Hazard mapping
Adoption and enforcement of land use and zoning practices
Implementing and enforcing building codes
Flood plain mapping
 Reinforced tornado safe rooms
 Burying of electrical cables to prevent ice build-up
 Raising of homes in flood-prone areas
 Disaster mitigation public awareness programs
 Insurance programs
